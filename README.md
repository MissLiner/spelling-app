## Conditional Styling & Event Listeners

I learned how to use the ternary operator to add condiional styling and 
event listeners to the letter tiles. I needed the text to be invisible 
until guessed, and wanted to remove the even listener once guessed.

I used useState to set the "open" state of each tile with a boolean, and
changed the color of the text and whether the event listener was
attached to the tile dependent on the open state.
